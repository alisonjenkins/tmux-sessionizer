# GitHub Profile, Local Repository Caching & Performance Optimizations

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve critical bugs in the GitHub profiles functionality, plus major UX and performance improvements including local repository caching and SIMD-accelerated JSON operations.

## Issues Fixed & Features Added

### 1. Profile Switching Bug - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: The profile switching did not allow swapping back to searching local git repos. Once in a GitHub profile mode, users were stuck and couldn't return to local repository browsing.

**Root Cause**: The picker's mode switching logic cycled through modes but wasn't intuitive and didn't clearly show available options.

**Solution**: 
- **Completely redesigned mode switching** with a dedicated fuzzy-searchable mode picker
- When Tab is pressed, shows a separate picker with all available modes: "Local repos", "GitHub - profile1", "GitHub - profile2", etc.
- Users can fuzzy search through modes and select the desired one
- Escape returns to the original picker without changing modes
- Current mode is highlighted as the initial selection
- Much more intuitive and discoverable UX

### 2. GitHub Credentials Command Bug - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: The GitHub profiles were running their credential command every time repositories were accessed, even when using cached data. This was inefficient and could cause unnecessary API calls or authentication prompts.

**Root Cause**: The `get_repositories()` method always called `get_access_token()` before checking if cached data could be used.

**Solution**:
- Restructured the credential flow to only call `get_access_token()` when actually needed (cache miss or force refresh)
- Added proper cache validation before attempting to fetch fresh data
- Made cache duration configurable instead of hard-coded

### 3. Hard-coded Cache Duration - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Cache duration was hard-coded to 1 hour, which was too frequent for most use cases.

**Solution**:
- Added `github_cache_duration_hours` configuration option
- Changed default from 1 hour to 30 days (720 hours)
- Made the cache duration configurable per user preference

### 4. 🚀 NEW: Local Repository Caching - PERFORMANCE BOOST ✅
**Problem**: Local repository scanning was performed on every startup, causing slow initial load times, especially for users with many repositories or slow storage.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive local repository caching system:

- **Smart Caching**: Local repositories and bookmarks are cached after first scan
- **Configurable Duration**: `local_cache_duration_hours` (default: 24 hours)
- **Configuration Validation**: Cache is invalidated if search paths or bookmarks change
- **Fallback Safety**: Falls back to direct scanning if cache is invalid
- **Performance**: Dramatic startup speed improvement for cached data

#### Cache Invalidation Triggers:
- Cache older than configured duration
- Search directories have changed  
- Bookmarks have changed
- User explicitly forces refresh (F5)
- Cache file is missing or corrupted

### 5. 🚀 NEW: SIMD-Accelerated JSON Operations - PERFORMANCE BOOST ✅
**Problem**: JSON serialization/deserialization was a performance bottleneck for large repository lists and cache operations.

**Solution**: Implemented high-performance JSON processing with SIMD acceleration:

- **SIMD JSON**: Uses `simd-json` crate for vectorized JSON processing
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to standard `serde_json` if SIMD fails
- **Transparent Integration**: Drop-in replacement for existing JSON operations
- **Performance Gains**: Significant improvements for large datasets
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with dual-path processing

#### SIMD JSON Features:
- **Vectorized Processing**: Leverages CPU SIMD instructions for faster parsing
- **Large Data Optimization**: Particularly effective for large repository lists
- **Compatibility**: Maintains full serde compatibility
- **Safety**: Graceful fallback ensures reliability across all platforms

## Major UX Improvement: Interactive Mode Picker

### New Mode Switching Behavior

**Before**: Tab key cycled through modes silently with no indication of available options.

**After**: Tab key opens a **fuzzy-searchable mode picker** with the following features:

- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search**: Type to filter available modes
- 📋 **Clear Options**: Shows all available modes with descriptive names
- 🎯 **Smart Selection**: Current mode is pre-selected
- ⌨️ **Intuitive Controls**: 
  - Arrow keys or type to navigate
  - Enter to select mode
  - Escape to cancel (returns to original picker unchanged)
- 💾 **State Persistence**: Selected mode is remembered between sessions

### Mode Picker Interface

```
┌─ Select Mode (3/3) ─────────────────────┐
│ > Local repos                           │
│   GitHub - work                         │  
│   GitHub - personal                     │
│                                         │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
Filter: _
```

Users can:
- Type "local" to quickly find local repos
- Type "work" to find work GitHub profile  
- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press Enter to switch to selected mode
- Press Escape to stay in current mode

## Configuration Changes

### New Configuration Options

```toml
# Cache duration for GitHub repository data (in hours)
# Default: 720 hours (30 days)
github_cache_duration_hours = 168  # 1 week example

# Cache duration for local repository data (in hours)  
# Default: 24 hours (1 day)
local_cache_duration_hours = 48    # 2 days example

# Mode switching keys (defaults shown)
picker_switch_mode_key = "tab"  # Opens mode picker
picker_refresh_key = "f5"       # Forces refresh of current mode

# Existing profile configuration remains the same
[[github_profiles]]
name = "work"
credentials_command = "gh auth token --hostname github.com"  
clone_root_path = "~/work/github"
clone_method = "SSH"
```

### Cache Storage Locations

Following XDG Base Directory Specification:
- **State**: `~/.local/state/tms/` (or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tms/`)
- **Cache**: `~/.cache/tms/` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tms/`)
  - GitHub caches: `~/.cache/tms/github/`
  - Local cache: `~/.cache/tms/local/sessions.json`

### API Changes

**GitHubClient::get_repositories()**
- **Before**: `get_repositories(&self, profile: &GitHubProfile, force_refresh: bool)`
- **After**: `get_repositories(&self, profile: &GitHubProfile, config: &Config, force_refresh: bool)`

**Session Creation**
- **Added**: `create_sessions_cached(&Config, force_refresh: bool)` - New cached version
- **Existing**: `create_sessions(&Config)` - Direct scanning (still available)

- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to direct scanning
- **Concurrent Safety**: Proper error handling for cache corruption

### Cache File Structure

```json
{
  "search_dirs": [...],
  "sessions": [...],
  "bookmarks": [...],
  "cached_at": 1640995200
}
```

### Mode Picker Architecture

The new mode picker is implemented as a lightweight, non-recursive picker that:
- Runs in its own terminal session to avoid recursion issues
- Uses simple filtering logic for fuzzy search
- Maintains the same visual style as the main picker
- Handles all standard navigation keys
- Properly restores the original picker state on cancel

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of terminal initialization failures
- Proper error propagation without breaking the main picker
- Fallback behavior if mode switching fails
- Cache corruption recovery
